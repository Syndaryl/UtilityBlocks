# UtilityBlocks
Compact versions of some common block types, tweaks to drop lists, new food items, and other stuff. One of THOSE mods.

LOTS of configuration options.

Animals occasionally drop a little bonemeal when killed (or even more occasionally, a bone).

Horses and pigs drop leather when killed occasionally.

WIP: Option to disable silverfish from the game.

* Adds tool handles, for making new mod tools. Created by laying three sticks diagonally.
* Adds sledge-hammers and mattocks for digging large volumes of stone or dirt. Costs saturation, so bring lots of food! Options are Wood (made from logs, not planks), stone (not cobblestone), iron, diamond, and (if enabled) obsidian.
  * sledge-hammers are made with six blocks of the appropriate material above a single centered handle item
  * mattocks are made with three blocks of the appropriate material above two centered handle items (like a pick)
* Adds a charcoal block. Like a coal block, but made out of charcoal. Derp.
* Adds compressed blocks for bulk storage. Fill a grid with them. Options are sand, gravel, dirt, cobblestone, stone, sandstone, bone, sugarcane, and flint. They decompress by putting one in the grid, which produces all 9 of the original items.
* Adds a cloth sack, for bulk storage of some items. Sacks are made from a U shape of wool.
  * Sacks can be filled with coco beans, potatoes, carrots, seeds, beetroot seeds, or feathers - one sack in the center of the grid, surrounded by 8 items.
  * Sacks are unpacked by putting them in the grid, which produces the 8 original items and the sack.
* Adds foods: apple_juice, apple_pie, eggnog, energy_drink, potato_juice, sugar_water, sugar_cube, sushi. (WIP: Drinks will have brief potion effects)
* Adds a few recipes for making vanilla items: 
  * You can make a feather out of 3 sugar cane and 3 leaf blocks (in a vertical row, cane on the left, leaf blocks on the right)
  * You can also make a feather out of one sugar cane and one wool block (cane on the left, leaf block on the right)
  * You can make flint by surrounding a gold nugget with 8 gravel (instead of paying a villager emeralds)
  * You can make woll out of 9 feathers.
  * You can break down one sandstone into sand
  * You can make grass by surrounding one dirt with 8 seeds

## CROSS MOD COMPATABILITY
If Base Metals and any mods adding on to Base Metals are installed, sledge-hammers and mattocks will be made for the Base Metals materials. Icons have been included for everything in Base Metals and Modern Metals at this time - other mods will need icons, but they'll work.
